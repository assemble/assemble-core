Built on top of [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) and [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates), assemble-core is used in [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) to provide the baseline features and API necessary for rendering templates, working with the file system, and running tasks.

Implementors and hackers can use assemble-core to create rich and powerful build tooling, project scaffolding systems, documentation generators, or even your completely custom static site generators. Learn more about [what you can do with assemble-core](#faq).

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save assemble-core
```

## Usage

```js
var assemble = require('assemble-core');
var app = assemble();
```

## Examples

**view collections**

Create a custom view collection:

```js
var app = assemble();
app.create('pages');
```

Now you can add pages with `app.page()` or `app.pages()`:

```js
app.page('home.hbs', {content: 'this is the home page!'});
```

**render**

Render a view:

```js
var app = assemble();

var view = app.view('foo', {content: 'Hi, my name is <%= name %>'});

app.render(view, { name: 'Brian' }, function(err, res) {
  console.log(res.content);
  //=> 'Hi, my name is Brian'
});
```

Render a view from a collection:

```js
var app = assemble();
app.create('pages');

app.page('foo', {content: 'Hi, my name is <%= name %>'})
  .set('data.name', 'Brian')
  .render(function (err, res) {
    console.log(res.content);
    //=> 'Hi, my name is Brian'
  });
```

## API

### [Assemble](index.js#L22)

Create an `assemble` application. This is the main function exported by the assemble module.

**Params**

* `options` **{Object}**: Optionally pass default options to use.

**Example**

```js
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();
```

***

### File System API

Assemble has the following methods for working with the file system:

* [src](#src)
* [dest](#dest)
* [copy](#copy)
* [symlink](#symlink)

Assemble v0.6.0 has full [vinyl-fs](http://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl-fs) support, so any [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) plugin should work with assemble.

#### .src

Use one or more glob patterns or filepaths to specify source files.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Glob patterns or file paths to source files.
* `options` **{Object}**: Options or locals to merge into the context and/or pass to `src` plugins

**Example**

```js
app.src('src/*.hbs', {layout: 'default'});
```

#### .dest

Specify the destination to use for processed files.

**Params**

* `dest` **{String|Function}**: File path or custom renaming function.
* `options` **{Object}**: Options and locals to pass to `dest` plugins

**Example**

```js
app.dest('dist/');
```

#### .copy

Copy files from A to B, where `A` is any pattern that would be valid in [app.src](#src) and `B` is the destination directory.

**Params**

* `patterns` **{String|Array}**: One or more file paths or glob patterns for the source files to copy.
* `dest` **{String|Function}**: Desination directory.
* `returns` **{Stream}**: The stream is returned, so you can continue processing files if necessary.

**Example**

```js
app.copy('assets/**', 'dist/');
```

#### .symlink

Glob patterns or paths for symlinks.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**

**Example**

```js
app.symlink('src/**');
```

***

### Task API

Assemble has the following methods for running tasks and controlling workflows:

* [task](#task)
* [build](#build)
* [watch](#watch)

#### .task

Define a task. Tasks are functions that are stored on a `tasks` object, allowing them to be called later by the [build](#build) method. (the [CLI](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-cli) calls [build](#build) to run tasks)

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: Task name
* `fn` **{Function}**: function that is called when the task is run.

**Example**

```js
app.task('default', function() {
  return app.src('templates/*.hbs')
    .pipe(app.dest('dist/'));
});
```

#### .build

Run one or more tasks.

**Params**

* `tasks` **{Array|String}**: Task name or array of task names.
* `cb` **{Function}**: callback function that exposes `err`

**Example**

```js
app.build(['foo', 'bar'], function(err) {
  if (err) console.error('ERROR:', err);
});
```

#### .watch

Watch files, run one or more tasks when a watched file changes.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Filepaths or glob patterns.
* `tasks` **{Array}**: Task(s) to watch.

**Example**

```js
app.task('watch', function() {
  app.watch('docs/*.md', ['docs']);
});
```

## FAQ

**What can I do with assemble-core?**

You can use assemble-core to create your own custom:

* blog engine
* project generator / scaffolder
* e-book development framework
* build system
* landing page generator
* documentation generator
* front-end UI framework
* rapid prototyping application
* static site generator
* web application

**How does assemble-core differ from [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble)?**

| **feature** | **assemble-core** | **assemble** | **notes** | 
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| front-matter parsing | No | Yes | use [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) or use [parser-front-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/parser-front-matter) as an `.onLoad` middleware. |
| CLI | No | Yes | Create your own CLI experience, or use [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) |
| Built-in template collections | No | Yes | Use `.create()` to add collections |
| Built-in template engine | No | Yes | [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) ships with [engine-handlebars](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/engine-handlebars). Use `.engine()` to register any [consolidate](https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js)-compatible template engine. |

## History

### v0.23.0

Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.23.0 to fix bug with double rendering in [engine-cache](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/engine-cache).

### v0.22.0

Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.22.0 to take advantage of fixes and improvements to lookup methods: `.find` and `getView`. No API changes were made. Please [let us know](../../issues) if regressions occur.

* fixes `List` bug that was caused collection helpers to explode
* Improvements to lookup functions: `app.getView()` and `app.find()`
* Bumps [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) to take advantages of code optimizations.

### v0.21.0

* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.21.0. Support for the `queue` property was removed on collections. See [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) for additional details.

### v0.20.0

* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.20.0. Some changes were made to context handling that effected one unit test out of ~1,000. although it's unlikely you'll be effected by the change, it warrants a minor bump

### v0.19.0

* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.19.0
* Externalizes tests (temporarily) to base-test-runner, until we get all of the tests streamlined to the same format.

### v0.18.0

* Bumps [assemble-loader](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-loader) to v0.5.0, which includes which fixes a bug where `renameKey` was not always being used when defined on collection loader options.
* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.18.0, which includes fixes for resolving layouts

### v0.17.0

* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.17.0

### v0.16.0

* Bumps [assemble-render-file](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-render-file) to v0.5.0 and [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.16.0

### v0.15.0

* Bumps [assemble-streams](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-streams) to v0.5.0

### v0.14.0

* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.15.1
* adds logging methods from [base-logger](https://github.com/node-base/base-logger) (`.log`, `.verbose`, etc)
* `.handleView` method is now deprecated, use `.handleOnce` instead
* Private method `.mergePartialsSync` rename was reverted to `.mergePartials` to be consistent with other updates in `.render` and `.compile`. No other breaking changes, but some new features were added to [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) for handling context in views and helpers.

### v0.13.0

* Breaking change: bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to v0.13.0 to fix obscure rendering bug when multiple duplicate partials were rendered in the same view. But the fix required changing the `.mergePartials` method to be async. If you're currently using `.mergePartials`, you can continue to do so synchronously using the `.mergePartialsSync` method.

### v0.9.0

* Updates [composer](https://github.com/doowb/composer) to v0.11.0, which removes the `.watch` method in favor of using the [base-watch](https://github.com/node-base/base-watch) plugin.

### v0.8.0

* Bumps several deps. [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) was bumped to 0.9.0 to take advantage of event handling improvements.

### v0.7.0

* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to 0.8.0 to take advantage of `isType` method for checking a collection type, and a number of improvements to how collections and views are instantiated and named.

### v0.6.0

* Bumps [assemble-fs](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-fs) plugin to 0.5.0, which introduces `onStream` and `preWrite` middleware handlers.
* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to 0.7.0, which fixes how non-cached collections are initialized. This was done as a minor instead of a patch since - although it's a fix - it could theoretically break someone's setup.

### v0.5.0

* Bumps [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) to latest, 0.6.0, since it uses the latest [base-methods](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/base-methods), which introduces prototype mixins. No API changes.

### v0.4.0

* Removed [emitter-only](https://github.com/doowb/emitter-only) since it was only includes to be used in the default listeners that were removed in an earlier release. In rare cases this might be a breaking change, but not likely.
* Adds lazy-cache
* Updates [assemble-streams](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-streams) plugin to latest
